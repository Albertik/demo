# Daily Deals

Daily Deals is an application built with Angular 2 that shows how you can add token based authentication to your Angular 2 applications. 

## Running the App

Install the dependencies by running `npm install`. Then run `node server` to serve your application.

You will need to remove the placeholder `AUTH0-CLIENT-SECRET`, `AUTH0-CLIENT-ID` strings in `server.js` and put in your [Auth0](https://manage.auth0.com) credentials. If you don't already have an Auth0 account, [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for a free one today.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
